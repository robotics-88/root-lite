# Babylon.js 3D Scene Loader

This project initializes a 3D scene using Babylon.js and allows loading `.ply` files into the scene.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Node.js installed, then install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

To have a model loaded by default, place a .ply file in the public folder

filename must be

splat.ply

This will trigger an attempt to fetch cameras.txt and images.txt from localhost:8000 --
The automated animation is turned off for the moment

### 3. Start the Development Server

```sh
npm run dev
```
